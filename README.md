# Score Board Application

This Python script creates a simple score board application using the `tkinter` library. The application allows users to register three teams and simulate matches between them, displaying the results and scoreboards.

## Instructions

1. Run the Python script in a compatible environment.
2. The application window will appear.
3. Enter the names of three teams in the respective entry fields.
4. Click the "Start" button to simulate matches and display the results and scoreboard.

## Script Explanation

The script utilizes `tkinter` to create a graphical user interface for the score board application. It defines functions for switching between light and dark themes, registering teams, and simulating matches. The application displays the results and scoreboards in a text widget.

### Functions

- `SwitchThemeToLight()`: Switches the theme to light mode.
- `SwitchThemeToDark()`: Switches the theme to dark mode.
- `SwitchTheme()`: Switches the theme based on provided colors.
- `clicked()`, `clicked2()`, `clicked3()`: Register teams and display their names.
